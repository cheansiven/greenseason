		<p>For 10 years we have lived in Asia working in the tourism industry, observing with increasing bafflement as tourists continue to flock to Asia in increasing numbers during the generally accepted “best time to travel to the region” which in our opinion, is overwhelmingly the WORST time to Travel.</p>

					<strong>See amazing and beautiful “in bloom”</strong> scenery that you don’t see in the high season.  “low season” has been renamed ‘Green Season” to more accurately reflect the sights during this amazing time to travel.

					<strong>Immerse yourself in the culture and relax in peace</strong> - Travel when there are significantly less tourists around to spoil the experience.  Some of the most popular tourist sites such as Angkor Wat can still be relatively busy year round, but in general, there can be up to a 90% reduction in Tourist arrivals in Green Season months – Experience Asia as it actually is, not having the experience ruined by too many other tourists and poor delivery of service as all involved in Tourism are too “busy”

					<strong>Experience tropical weather</strong> Of course we can make no guarantees about weather but we can say it will not be cold and there is a very high chance of lots of sun. April to July is likely to be very Hot.  Of course it can rain at any time (as it also can in the cool/dry (high) season), and from august to September is the rainy season and the highest chance of rain.  But it is still warm and exotic – a tropical climate, and there is still also high probability of lots of sun.  Typically it rains for a short burst and then stops, it rarely rains consistently all day, and even more rarely for many days.  This is not the energy sapping, soul destroying, depressing and freezing drizzle of a cold winter in Europe, this is tropical exotic heavy showers that are looked forward to cool the temperature down – something to be celebrated in these cultures as reflected in some of the festivals taking place during this period.   In Green Season you Experience the REAL Asia.
