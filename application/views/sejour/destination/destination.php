    <p>For 10 years we have lived in Asia working in the tourism industry, observing with increasing bafflement as tourists continue to flock to Asia in increasing numbers during the generally accepted “best time to travel to the region” which in our opinion, is overwhelmingly the WORST time to Travel.</p>

          <p><b>Immerse yourself in the culture and relax in peace</b> - Travel when there are significantly less tourists around to spoil the experience.  Some of the most popular tourist sites such as Angkor Wat can still be relatively busy year round, but in general, there can be up to a 90% reduction in Tourist arrivals in Green Season months – Experience Asia as it actually is, not having the experience ruined by too many other tourists and poor delivery of service as all involved in Tourism are too “busy” </p>
